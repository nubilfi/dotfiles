# i3 and Polybar Configs

This setup is only for Archlinux and its instances, so please find all related packages name according to your Linux distro and configure it manually.

Add execution mode for [`teal_mode_install.sh`](https://github.com/nubilfi/dotfiles/blob/master/i3wm-polybar/teal_mode_install.sh) file `chmod +x teal_mode_install.sh`. Then follow the instructions. FYI, forget about the `system-fonts.zip` file, it's only for me.
