# i3 and Polybar Configs

This setup is specifically designed for Arch Linux and its derivatives. For users on different Linux distributions, please refer to your respective package manager to identify and install the equivalent packages required for this configuration manually.

To initiate the installation process, ensure executable permissions for the [`teal_mode_install.sh`](https://github.com/nubilfi/dotfiles/blob/master/i3wm-polybar/teal_mode_install.sh) file by executing `chmod +x teal_mode_install.sh`. Follow the provided instructions thereafter.

Note that the `system-fonts.zip` file included is tailored for my personal use and isn't necessary for the setup.
