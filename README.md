# dotfiles

It contains a basic configurations from my machine, one of them is vim section that you can see through the following URL:

- Setting up [Vim](https://github.com/nubilfi/dotfiles/tree/master/vim)
- Setting up [VSCode](https://github.com/nubilfi/dotfiles/tree/master/vscode)
- Setting up [Sublime](https://github.com/nubilfi/dotfiles/tree/master/sublime)

**NOTES: I decided to include vscode and sublime configs, so i can easily using it in the future.

These all config files are from my Archlinux machine and supposed to be used by my own, and of course i'll appreciate for any feedback.
