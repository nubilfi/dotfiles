# dotfiles

It contains a basic configurations from my machine, you can see through the following URL:

- Setting up [i3 + Polybar](https://github.com/nubilfi/dotfiles/tree/master/i3wm-polybar)
- Setting up [NeoVim](https://github.com/nubilfi/dotfiles/tree/master/vim)

All of these configuration files came from my Linux machine and are meant to be used by me. Of course, I'd appreciate any comments.
